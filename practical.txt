Use a wire of arbitrary length L. Measure its resistance across ends A
and B, say R1
, using the metre bridge. Next, fold the wire so as to reduce
its length to (L/2) and measure the new resistance, say R2
, across the
ends A′ and B′. Finally, fold it again and repeat the observation for
resistance across ends A″ and B″. Plot a graph of n (number of folds)
and the effective resistance, by folding the wire a number of times and
obtaining resistances as described above. Take care that folded wires
do not make electrical contact with each other at any point except at
their ends (A, B, A′, B′ and A″, B″).
